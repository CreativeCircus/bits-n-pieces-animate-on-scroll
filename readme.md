# TweenMax/TimelineMax animation tied to scroll position

## 1. What?
ScrollMagic and Superscrollorama are popular plugins for making web experiences in which series of animations are controlled by the user scrolling down the page. Those two plugins have grown to meet community demand for more features,  but this has made them overcomplicated. So I made a super light version of the core mechanic: a Timeline controlled by scrolling.

## 2. Requirements
TimelineMax (included in TweenMax) for the animation.
Absolutely watch this video on how to set up TimelineMax timelines first. https://greensock.com/sequence-video

## 3. Usage
* Try out the example first, and peruse the main.js file to see how it works.
* Copy the javascript into your project, and change the tweens to what you need. 
* Scroll. Enjoy.
